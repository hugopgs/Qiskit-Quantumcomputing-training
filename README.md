# The hello world example on a 2-qubit state
## Training from : Qiskit, IBM Quantum computing

"This example contains two parts. You will first create a simple quantum program and run it on a quantum system. 
Because actual quantum research requires much more robust programs, in the second section (Scale to large numbers of qubits), you will scale the simple program up to utility level."

## The four steps to writing a quantum program using Qiskit Patterns are:

*  Map the problem to a quantum-native format.

*  Optimize the circuits and operators.

* Execute using a quantum primitive function.

* Analyze the results.
