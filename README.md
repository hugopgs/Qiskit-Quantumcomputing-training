# Quantum computing

## Training from : Qiskit, IBM Quantum computing

### Contain: 

* Helloworld Qiskit : "This example contains two parts. You will first create a simple quantum program and run it on a quantum system. 
Because actual quantum research requires much more robust programs, in the second section (Scale to large numbers of qubits), you will scale the simple program up to utility level."

*  Primitives

* Grover's algorithm :""
